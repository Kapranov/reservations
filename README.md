Create simple application for restaurant tables reservations.
-------------------------------------------------------------

* Write a migration and ActiveRecord model that tracks restaurant
  reservations.
* Assume there is a table in your relational database named
  "reservations".
* Reservations have a start time, an end time and a table number.
* Write some ActiveRecord validations that check new reservations
  for overbooking of the same table in the restaurant.

For example, table #10 cannot have 2 reservations for the same period
of time. This validation(s) should check time overlap for both record
creation and updates.
